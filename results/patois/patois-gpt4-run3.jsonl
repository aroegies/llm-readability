{"instruction": "Wa mek formula one car so fast?", "input": "", "output": "Formula One cars are so fast due to a combination of several factors:\n\n1. Powerful Engines: Formula One cars usually have highly powerful and efficient 1.6-liter turbocharged V6 engines that can produce up to 1000 horsepower. \n\n2. Aerodynamics: The car\u2019s design is very streamlined which reduces air resistance and allows them to move faster.\n\n3. Lightweight: Formula One cars are made from lightweight materials like carbon fiber, which helps increase speed without compromising on strength.\n\n4. Tires: They use specially designed tires that provide exceptional grip on the road, thus, increasing speed.\n\n5. Advanced Technology: The incorporation of cutting-edge technology in design, materials, and building processes also make these cars faster.\n\n6. Highly Skilled Drivers: The driver's skills and experience also play a significant role in how fast the car goes. They understand the optimal lines to take on the track, when to push the car, and when to hold back. \n\n7. Suspension and Brakes: Formula One cars have extremely sophisticated suspension and brake systems which allow high-speed cornering and rapid deceleration, contributing to faster lap times.\n\nEach team puts in extensive research and development to make their cars as fast as possible within the regulations set by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA)."}
{"instruction": "\"How you drive stick shift?\"", "input": "", "output": "Driving a stick shift, also known as a manual transmission, can seem complex, but with practice, it will become second nature. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. Familiarize Yourself: First, understand the basics about your car. A manual car has three pedals: the clutch on the far left, the brake in the middle, and the gas/accelerator pedal on the far right. The gear selector has a diagram to indicate which position corresponds to which gear.\n\n2. Start the Car: Press the brake pedal down and then turn the ignition. While starting, your gear should always be in neutral (middle of the gear box) and your clutch should be pressed down.\n\n3. Shifting Gears: To move the car, press the clutch down and shift the gear to first. Slowly release the clutch pedal while simultaneously pressing the gas pedal. Once the car starts moving, fully release the clutch.\n\n4. Upshift: As your speed increases, you'll need to shift to higher gears. To do this, release the gas, press the clutch, shift to the next higher gear, and then slowly release the clutch while pressing the gas.\n\n5. Downshift: When you're slowing down, you'll need to shift to a lower gear. Release the gas, press the clutch, shift to the next lower gear, and then slowly release the clutch.\n\n6. Stopping: When you're about to stop, press the clutch down fully and shift the gear back to neutral, then use the brake as needed.\n\n7. Hill Starts: Starting on a hill can be a bit tricky. Use the handbrake to keep the car from rolling back while you're doing the same footwork to get the car moving as you would on flat ground. Once the car starts moving, release the handbrake.\n\nRemember, practice is key when it comes to driving stick shift. It might take some time to smooth out your starts and gear changes, but once you get the hang of it, it can be a lot of fun to drive a manual car."}

{"instruction": "how you mek soap?", "input": "", "output": "Making soap at home can be a fun and rewarding DIY project. Here's a simple recipe for handmade soap:\n\nMaterials You'll Need:\n\n1. 236 ml of distilled water\n2. 86 grams of lye (sodium hydroxide)\n3. 567 grams of olive oil\n4. Soap mold\n5. Safety goggles, gloves, and long-sleeved shirt\n6. Stick blender\n7. Thermometer\n8. Stainless steel pot\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Protect your work area with newspaper or a drop cloth.\n2. Put on your safety goggles, gloves, and long-sleeved shirt.\n3. Carefully add the lye to your distilled water (not the other way around), stirring constantly until the lye is fully dissolved. The mixture will get hot, so be careful. Allow this mixture to cool.\n4. While the lye mixture is cooling, add your olive oil to the stainless steel pot and heat it gently to around 43-49\u00b0C (110-120\u00b0F). \n5. Once both mixtures are about the same temperature, you can slowly pour the lye mixture into the pot with the oil.\n6. Use the stick blender to bring the soap \u2018to trace\u2019. This is when the oils and lye solution have emulsified. It will have the consistency of a light pudding.\n7. At this point, you can add any extra ingredients like essential oils or colors, then blend some more.\n8. Pour the soap mixture into your mold.\n9. Cover the mold with a towel or blanket to keep it warm and leave it undisturbed for 24 hours.\n10. After 24 hours, check if it's solid enough to remove from the mold. If so, you can cut it into bars immediately.\n11. Let the bars cure in a cool, dry place with good ventilation for 4-6 weeks before use. The soap is safe to touch 48 hours after making it but it needs the extra time to let any remaining water content to evaporate out.\n\nRemember, always handle lye with care. It's a caustic substance. If it gets on your skin, wash it off with cool water. If it gets in your eyes, rinse them thoroughly and contact a doctor.\n"}
