{"instruction": "Wa mek formula one car so fast?", "input": "", "output": "Formula One cars are incredibly fast due to several factors:\n\n1. Powerful Engines: F1 cars are equipped with extremely powerful engines that can produce over 1000 horsepower, enabling them to reach incredible speeds.\n\n2. Aerodynamics: F1 cars are designed with a key focus on aerodynamics. The shape of the car is designed in a way to decrease air resistance (drag) as much as possible.\n\n3. Light Weight: The materials used in F1 cars are light but strong, reducing the overall weight of the car and making it easier for it to reach high speeds. \n\n4. Tyres: The tyres used on F1 cars are designed for maximum grip on the track, enabling them to navigate at high speeds without skidding or losing control.\n\n5. High-tech Systems: F1 cars are equipped with advanced technology such as energy recovery systems and drag reduction systems which further enhance their performance and speed.\n\n6. Highly Skilled Drivers: Finally, the skill of the drivers also plays a big role in the speed of F1 cars as they know how to take advantage of every bit of power and grip to extract maximum speed from the car."}
{"instruction": "\"How you drive stick shift?\"", "input": "", "output": "Driving a manual car involves balancing a clutch, throttle (gas pedal), brakes, and gear stick. Here are some basic steps to follow:\n\n1. Before starting the car, familiarize yourself with the pedals. From left to right they are clutch, brake, and accelerator.\n\n2. Familiarize yourself with the gear shift. Usually, a diagram on the top of the gear stick shows the layout of the gear positions. Typically it's a pattern from top to bottom, left to right.\n\n3. Before starting the car, press down on the clutch pedal.\n\n4. Start the car.\n\n5. To move forward, shift the gear to first gear (usually to the left and up).\n\n6. Slowly release the clutch until the car starts to roll a bit. This is called the \"bite point.\"\n\n7. As you feel the bite point, begin to gently press on the gas pedal.\n\n8. As the car gathers more speed, you will have to shift to second gear and so on. To do this, you need to release your foot from the gas briefly, press the clutch all the way down, move the gear stick to the next gear, and then slowly release the clutch as you gently press on the gas.\n\n9. To stop, decrease your speed with the brake pedal, and when you're speed is low enough, press down the clutch all the way and shift into neutral.\n\n10. Whenever you stop the car completely, use the clutch to put the car into neutral so you can release the clutch while waiting to start moving again.\n\nRemember, it takes practice to smoothly balance the gas pedal and clutch. Do not be discouraged if the car stalls a few times when you\u2019re just starting to learn. Take your time to practice and get used to the car's responses."}

{"instruction": "how you mek soap?", "input": "", "output": "Soap can be made at home using a variety of methods. Here is a basic cold process method:\n\nIngredients:\n1. 10 ounces coconut oil\n2. 10 ounces olive oil\n3. 3 ounces rice bran oil\n4. 13 ounces other oil (like sunflower or safflower)\n5. 5.5 ounces lye\n6. 12 ounces water\n7. 0.5\u20131 ounces essential oils for scent \n\nProcedure:\n\n1. Put on protective gear. This includes goggles and gloves.\n\n2. Carefully measure the lye and water in two separate containers. \n\n3. Slowly pour the lye into the water (not the other way around), stirring until the lye is fully dissolved.\n\n4. In a separate container, add the coconut oil, olive oil, rice bran oil, and the other oil. Heat the oils to approximately 110-130\u00b0F.\n\n5. When both the lye and the oils are at the correct temperature, slowly pour the lye solution into the oils. \n\n6. Mix with a stick blender until the soap reaches \u2018trace\u2019, which is when the soap has thickened enough so when you drizzle a bit of it across the surface, it leaves a trail or \u201ctrace\u201d. This can take anywhere from 5-15 minutes.\n\n7. Add essential oils and any colorants, herbs, or other optional ingredients, thoroughly mixing everything together.\n\n8. Pour the traced soap batter into a mold.\n\n9. Cover the mold with a lid or a piece of cardboard, and insulate with towels.\n\n10. Let the soap sit and harden for 24 hours.\n\n11. After 24 hours, remove your soap from the mold and cut it into bars.\n\n12. Let the bars cure in an open-air place for 4-6 weeks. This allows all of the lye to react with the oils, and evaporates any remaining water.\n\nRemember, lye is a dangerous chemical, so all steps should be done with careful precision and adults should always supervise if children are involved in the process. Always do your research and understand the chemical reactions involved before attempting to make soap at home."}
