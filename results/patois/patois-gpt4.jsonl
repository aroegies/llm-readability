{"instruction": "\"How you drive stick shift?\"", "input": "", "output": "Driving a stick shift, also known as a manual transmission vehicle, involves the use of both a clutch pedal and a gear shift. Here are basic instructions on how to do it:\n\n1. Familiarize Yourself with the Pedals: The left pedal is the clutch, the middle is the brake, and the right pedal is the accelerator or gas pedal. Your left foot should always be on the clutch while your right foot will switch between the brake and gas pedals.\n\n2. Understand the Gear Shifter: Usually, the gear shifter is located in between the driver\u2019s and passenger\u2019s seats. Gear positions are typically outlined on top of the stick shift. \n\n3. To Start the Car: Press the clutch pedal all the way to the floor, and hold it there. Turn on the ignition and as you keep holding the clutch pedal, move the gear shifter into first gear.\n\n4. To Start Moving: Release the clutch slowly while simultaneously pressing on the gas pedal. As you release the clutch, the car will start to move.\n\n5. To Shift Gears: As you gain speed, you\u2019ll need to shift from first gear to second, then third, and so on. To do so, let go of the gas pedal and press the clutch pedal, then move the gear stick to the desired gear (second, third etc.) Once the gear is selected, release the clutch slowly and start applying gas again.\n\n6. To Stop: If you're coming to a stop or slowing down, press the brake and clutch at the same time, and shift the car into neutral.\n\n7. To Park: If you want to park the car, use the brake pedal to come to a complete stop, then shift into first or reverse depending on your parking orientation. Then, turn off the car's ignition.\n\nPracticing these steps in a safe, open area can help you familiarize yourself with the process, and always remember to stay calm while driving as it can take some time to become proficient with a manual transmission vehicle."}

{"instruction": "Wah mek the world go 'roun ?", "input": "", "output": "There are several interpretations to this question based on cultural, philosophical, and scientific perspectives. Here are a few possible answers:\n\n1. Scientifically, the world goes 'round due to the laws of physics, specifically gravity and the momentum generated from the Big Bang.\n2. From a philosophical or spiritual perspective, some people might say love, unity, or religion makes the world go 'round, meaning these elements are the driving forces behind human actions.\n3. In a more concrete sense, one could argue that economics - specifically trade and commerce - make the world go 'round as they are the foundations of societal structure.\n4. Finally, from an ecological standpoint, the cycle of energy through the ecosystem - particularly the sun's energy through photosynthesis - could be said to make the world go 'round. \n\nRemember that this is a proverbial phrase and its interpretation can vary greatly depending on who you ask."}

{"instruction": "how you mek soap?", "input": "", "output": "Making soap can be a simple or complex process depending on the method you choose. Here is a simplified, general process of soap making:\n\nMaterials Needed:\n1. An accurate scale\n2. A large stainless steel or enameled pot\n3. A thermometer\n4. Safety goggles and rubber gloves\n5. White Vinegar (to neutralize in case lye gets on your skin)\n6. A mold (can be a simple like a cardboard box lined with parchment paper)\n7. Stick Blender (optional but helpful)\n\nIngredients:\n1. 10 ounces of palm oil\n2. 10 ounces of coconut oil\n3. 10 ounces of olive oil\n4. 12 ounces of water (distilled is best)\n5. 4.5 ounces of lye\n6. 0.8 ounces of essential oil (for scent)\n   \nProcedure:\n1. Put on your goggles and gloves. Lye is a caustic material, and mishandling it can cause burns.\n2. Accurately weigh your water and pour it into the large pot. Weigh the lye and carefully pour it into the water. Stir gently until the lye is completely dissolved. The mixture will heat. Allow to cool to about 110 degrees Fahrenheit.\n3. While the lye solution is cooling, weigh the oils and put them into the pot. Heat gently to about 110 degrees Fahrenheit.\n4. Slowly pour the lye solution into the oils. Stir gently to combine.\n5. Use a stick blender to mix the soaps. The mixture will turn creamy and eventually, like pudding. This is called 'trace'. When your soap mixture leaves a trail or \u201ctrace\u201d on the surface, it\u2019s time to add your chosen additives and scent. \n6. Pour the finished soap batter into your prepared mold. Cover the mold with a piece of cardboard and then a towel. This keeps the heat in and starts the \u2018saponification\u2019 process by which oils are transformed into soap.\n7. Leave the soap in the mold for 24 hours. Uncover and allow to cool, then cut into bars.\n8. Leave the soap bars open to the air to cure and dry for about a month.\n\nRemember, homemade soap also makes a lovely gift, and can be personalized with the scents and additives that your friends or family love.\n\nNote: Lye is a very dangerous and caustic chemical. Soap making must be performed with proper protective equipment and in a well-ventilated area. Always have vinegar nearby to neutralize the lye solution if it comes in contact with your skin. Keep children, pets, and other distractions out of the house while you are making soap. Never let soap ingredients or chemicals come in contact with eyes, skin or clothing."}

{"instruction": "Why mi cookie dem come out flat?", "input": "", "output": "There could be several reasons why your cookies are coming out flat:\n\n1. Incorrect Butter: If you're using melted butter instead of softened, this could cause your cookies to spread too much in the oven. Also, using margarine or vegetable shortening, which melts at a higher temperature than butter, can also cause flat cookies. Butter is 80% fat while margarine and shortening are nearly 100% fat.\n\n2. Overbeating the Batter: Over-mixing can cause your cookies to come out flat. It introduces too much air into the dough and causes the cookies to rise and then fall in the oven.\n\n3. Too Little Flour: If there isn't enough flour to hold the structure of the cookies, they could spread out and flatten in the oven.\n\n4. Old Baking Soda or Baking Powder: If your leavening agents are old, they might not puff up your cookies as much as they should. Try replacing them if they're more than six months old.\n\n5. Oven Temperature: If your oven runs too hot or too cool, it could affect how your cookies bake. Consider testing your oven's temperature with an oven thermometer to make sure it's accurate.\n\n6. Cookie Dough Temperature: If the dough is too warm before baking, the cookies might spread out too much in the oven. Chilling the dough before baking can help prevent this.\n\n7. Over-Greased Baking Sheet: Too much grease can cause cookies to spread."}
{"instruction": "Wa mek Chicago so windy?", "input": "", "output": "Chicago is known as the \"Windy City\" but this isn't entirely due to its physical geography. Here are a few reasons for Chicago's windy reputation:\n\n1. Weather Patterns: Chicago sits on the southwestern edge of Lake Michigan, and the differences in temperature between the lake and the land can often create breezy conditions as warmer air over the land rises and cooler air from the lake rushes in to take its place.\n\n2. Urban Design: The layout of tall buildings can create wind tunnels, making certain areas of the city feel more windy.\n\n3. Notoriety and Reputation: However, the main reason for the nickname is not necessarily its actual windiness. The nickname \"Windy City\" was popularized during the city's bid to host the 1893 World's Fair, where city politicians were labeled as full of hot air, and therefore \"windy\". The nickname stuck and is now commonly misinterpreted to be about the actual weather. \n\nIn terms of recorded wind speeds, Chicago does not rank in the top 10 windiest cities in the United States. Places like Dodge City, Kansas and Amarillo, Texas are actually windier in terms of average wind speed.\n"}
