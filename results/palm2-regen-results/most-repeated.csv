Take this essay and reduce its word count to 500 words,"The purpose of this research paper is to examine the reasons why students choose to attend college right after high school and to analyze the benefits and drawbacks of this decision. 		College has always been seen as an important part of the American dream. It has been viewed by many as the ticket to a better life, providing access to better jobs and greater economic stability. It also gives individuals a chance to further their education, which can grant them more opportunities in the professional world. 		Unfortunately, the cost of attending college has skyrocketed in recent years; tuition costs and fees make college increasingly difficult for the average student to attend. Despite the costs, students continue to attend college, citing the need for new skills, increased job opportunities and increased earning potential.		In addition to the financial implications of college, students must also consider the social implications. College can be a stressful experience, and the pressure to perform academically can be overwhelming. Furthermore, it can be difficult to transition from the relatively sheltered lifestyle of living at home to living on one's own.		In conclusion, attending college immediately after high school comes with its share of risks, but it is possible to find success in this endeavor. With proper planning, dedication and determination, the benefits of obtaining a college degree outweigh the risks."
