Take this essay and reduce its word count to 500 words,"The purpose of this research paper is to examine the reasons why students choose to attend college right after high school and to analyze the benefits and drawbacks of this decision. 		College has always been seen as an important part of the American dream. It has been viewed by many as the ticket to a better life, providing access to better jobs and greater economic stability. It also gives individuals a chance to further their education, which can grant them more opportunities in the professional world. 		Unfortunately, the cost of attending college has skyrocketed in recent years; tuition costs and fees make college increasingly difficult for the average student to attend. Despite the costs, students continue to attend college, citing the need for new skills, increased job opportunities and increased earning potential.		In addition to the financial implications of college, students must also consider the social implications. College can be a stressful experience, and the pressure to perform academically can be overwhelming. Furthermore, it can be difficult to transition from the relatively sheltered lifestyle of living at home to living on one's own.		In conclusion, attending college immediately after high school comes with its share of risks, but it is possible to find success in this endeavor. With proper planning, dedication and determination, the benefits of obtaining a college degree outweigh the risks."

Write a summary for the paper given in the input.,"Abstract: Fine-tuning continuous prompts for target tasks has recently emerged as a compact alternative to full model fine-tuning. Motivated by these promising results, we investigate the feasibility of extracting a discrete (textual) interpretation of continuous prompts that is faithful to the problem they solve. In practice, we observe a ""wayward"" behavior between the task solved by continuous prompts and their nearest neighbor discrete projections: We can find continuous prompts that solve a task while being projected to an arbitrary text (e.g., definition of a different or even a contradictory task), while being within a very small (2%) margin of the best continuous prompt of the same size for the task. We provide intuitions behind this odd and surprising behavior, as well as extensive empirical analyses quantifying the effect of various parameters. For instance, for larger model sizes we observe higher waywardness, i.e, we can find prompts that more closely map to any arbitrary text with a smaller drop in accuracy. These findings have important implications relating to the difficulty of faithfully interpreting continuous prompts and their generalization across models and tasks, providing guidance for future progress in prompting language models."
